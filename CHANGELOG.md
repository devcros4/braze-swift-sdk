## 5.11.2

##### Fixed
- Fixes a crash occurring when the SDK is configured with a flush interval of `0` and network connectivity is poor.

## 5.11.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing the correct calculation of the delay when retrying failed requests. This led to a more aggressive retry schedule than intended.
- Improves the performance of Live Activity tracking by de-duping push token tag requests.
- Fixes an issue in `logClick(using:)` where it would incorrectly open the `url` field in addition to logging a click for metrics. It now only logs a click for metrics.
  - This applies to the associated APIs for content cards, in-app messages, and news feed cards.
  - It is still recommended to use the associated `Context` object to log interactions instead of these APIs.

##### Added
- Adds [`BrazeKit.overrideResourcesBundle`] and [`BrazeUI.overrideResourcesBundle`] to allow for custom resource bundles to be used by the SDK.
  - This feature is useful when your setup prevents you from using the default resource bundle (e.g. Tuist).

[`BrazeKit.overrideResourcesBundle`]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/overrideresourcebundle
[`BrazeUI.overrideResourcesBundle`]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/overrideresourcebundle/

## 5.11.0

##### Added
- Adds support for [Live Activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit/displaying-live-data-with-live-activities) via the `liveActivities` module on the Braze instance.
  - This feature provides the following new methods for tracking and managing Live Activities with the Braze push server:
    - `launchActivity(pushTokenTag:activity:)`
    - `resumeActivities(ofType:)`
  - This feature requires iOS 16.1 and up.
  - To learn how to integrate this feature, refer to the [setup tutorial](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/b4-live-activities/).
- Adds logic to re-synchronize Content Cards on SDK version changes.
- Adds provisional support for Xcode 14.3 Beta via the [`braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-xcode-14-3-preview`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-xcode-14-3-preview) repository.

## 5.10.1

##### Changed
- Dynamic versions of the prebuilt xcframeworks are now available in the `braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt.zip` release artifact.

## 5.10.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where test content cards were removed before their expiration date.
- Fixes an issue in `BrazeUICompat` where the status bar appearance wasn't restored to its original state after dismissing a full in-app message.
- Fixes an issue when decoding notification payloads where some valid boolean values weren't correctly parsed.

##### Changed
- In-app modal and full-screen messages are now rendered with `UITextView`, which better supports large amounts of text and extended UTF code points.

## 5.9.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing local expired content cards from being removed.
- Fixes a behavior that could lead to background tasks extending beyond the expected time limit with inconsistent network connectivity.

##### Added
- Adds `logImpression(using:)` and `logClick(buttonId:using:)` to news feed cards.

## 5.9.0

##### Breaking
- Raises the minimum deployment target to iOS 11.0 and tvOS 11.0.
- Raises the Xcode version to 14.1 (14B47b).

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where the post-click webview would close automatically in some cases.
- Fixes a behavior where the current user messaging data would not be directly available after initializing the SDK or calling `changeUser(userId:)`.
- Fixes an issue preventing News Feed data models from being available offline.
- Fixes an issue where the release binaries could emit warnings when generating dSYMs.

##### Changed
- SwiftPM and CocoaPods now use the same release assets.

##### Added
- Adds support for the upcoming Braze Feature Flags product.
- Adds the `braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt.zip` archive to the release assets.
  - This archive contains the prebuilt xcframeworks and their associated resource bundles.
  - The content of this archive can be used to manually integrate the SDK.
- Adds the `Examples-Manual.xcodeproj` showcasing how to integrate the SDK using the prebuilt release assets.
- Adds support for Mac Catalyst for example applications, available at [Support/Examples/](./Support/Examples/README.md)
- Adds support to convert from `Data` into an in-app message, content card, or news feed card via `decoding(json:)`.

## 5.8.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes a conflict with the shared instance of [`ProcessInfo`], allowing low power mode notifications to trigger correctly.

##### Changed
- Renames the `BrazeLocation` class to `BrazeLocationProvider` to avoid shadowing the module of the same name ([SR-14195](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-14195)).

[`ProcessInfo`]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/processinfo

## 5.8.0

To help migrate your app from the Appboy-iOS-SDK to our Swift SDK, this release includes the `Appboy-iOS-SDK` [migration guide]:
- Follow step-by-step instructions to migrate each feature to the new APIs.
- Includes instructions for a minimal migration scenario via our compatibility libraries.

##### Added
- Adds compatibility libraries `BrazeKitCompat` and `BrazeUICompat`:
  - Provides all the old APIs from `Appboy-iOS-SDK` to easily start migrating to the Swift SDK.
  - See the [migration guide] for more details.
- Adds support for [News Feed](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/news_feed) data models and analytics.
  - News Feed UI is not supported by the Swift SDK. See the [migration guide] for instructions on using the compatibility UI.

[migration guide]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/braze/appboy-migration-guide

## 5.7.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where modal image in-app messages would not respect the aspect ratio of the image when the height of the image is larger than its width.

##### Changed
- Changes modal, modal image, full, and full image in-app message view attributes to use the `ViewDimension` type for their `minWidth`, `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` attributes.
  - The `ViewDimension` type enables providing different values for regular and large size-classes.

##### Added
- Adds a configuration to use a randomly generated UUID instead of IDFV as the device ID: [`useUUIDAsDeviceId`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/configuration-swift.class/useuuidasdeviceid).
  - This configuration defaults to `false`. To opt in to this feature, set this value to `true`.
  - Enabling this value will only affect new devices. Existing devices will use the device identifier that was previously registered.

## 5.6.4

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing the execution of `BrazeDelegate` methods when setting the delegate using Objective-C.
- Fixes an issue where triggering an in-app message twice with the same event did not place the message on the in-app message stack under certain conditions.

##### Added
- Adds the public `id` field to `Braze.InAppMessage.Data`.
- Adds `logImpression(using:)` and `logClick(buttonId:using:)` to both in-app messages and content cards, and adds `logDismissed(using:)` to content cards.
  - It is recommended to continue using the associated `Context` to log impressions, clicks, and dismissals for the majority of use cases.
- Adds Swift concurrency to support async/await versions of the following public methods. These methods can be used as alternatives to their corresponding counterparts that use completion handlers:
  - [`Braze.User.id()`]
  - [`Braze.deviceId()`]
  - [`ContentCards.requestRefresh()`]
  - [`ContentCards.cardsStream`] as an alternative to [`ContentCards.subscribeToUpdates(_:)`]

- Fixes the `InAppMessageRaw` to `InAppMessage` conversion to properly take into account the `extras` dictionary and the `duration`.
- Fixes an issue preventing the execution of the [`braze(_:sdkAuthenticationFailedWithError:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/brazedelegate/braze(_:sdkauthenticationfailedwitherror:)-505pz) delegate method in case of an authentication error.
